Homework 5

I have Created a multiple choice Chicago Bears Trivia Game with a timer.

The player will have 4 options to each question and will be alerted after each answer whether or not they guessed right.

The player will not be able to pick more than one option.

After the final question a result screen will pop up and let the player know how they did on the quiz.
